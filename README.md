The purpose of this project is educational.
General strategies and technologies that will be used:
- Backend will be written in Java, Spring and frontend in React js, postgres for database for now.
- backend will be a microservice, will have multiple instances.
- Client and server communications will be using WebSockets.
- Syncronizing data between instances will use Messaging (kafka/RabbitMQ/Redis pubsub)
- It is questionable how well and realtime will the syncronizations be.
- implement CI/CD principles. Use Jenkins/CircleCi.
- Testing must be a big part.
- Containerization.
